FNF: Vs EpicBoiz Lore (-ish)


Eweek1: Bf and Gf go in a Public Server in "Funky Friday" on Roblox, 
They encounter n_bonnie2 (which was the first person they saw not in a
round near Milo Borgar), and Bf asked hime for a 1v1, n_bonnie2 gets pissed
in "Outrage" which makes him give his all. 

After that, bon sent Bf a friend request so they can play again.

That is where it started...

Eweek2: The next week, Bf and Gf went into Doomsphire BrickBattle, where they
encounterd Jack_E_, Bf insisted to rap, but Jack said That this isn't FF, But they
sing anyways while Jack_E_ was trying to shoot down Bf.

Eweek3: This is maybe one of the more "unstructured" weeks in this mod, Bf and Gf
go into SFOTH, and dragged evilguestandraven into it and said they wanted to rap or something
they did (because plot armor) and then in the last song, evil pulled out the Darkheart and Illumina
(two swords from Roblox) and did shit (Bf and Gf stood still, because canoncally they are so stupid
that they are fearless)... 

What Happens in the end of Eclipse: Bf and Gf left the game...
